## Project Summary

Capable Carrier is a voice-activated chatbot demo for logistics carriers.  
It helps owner-operators and small fleets handle broker, driver, and dispatcher conversations.  
Built with Voiceflow, it answers questions about load status, ETAs, and document handling.  
This demo shows how automation can improve deal flow, reduce delays, and free up time.  
Capable Carrier is ideal for those without full-time office staff or 24/7 communication teams.
